<p>I know how hard it is to build developer trust and community because I've done it as part of the Community Team at Respoke. I'd love the opportunity to do it again.</p>

<p><br></p>

<h2>Strong technical writing skills</h2>

<p>Take a look at the documentation reorganization I lead at Respoke and a few blog posts and screencasts I produced along the way.</p>

<p><br></p>

<h3>Documentation</h3>

<p>Lead the documentation and reorganization of Respoke's developer docs along product lines - Client libraries (JavaScript, iOS, Android), Server libraries (Node, Ruby, .NET, PHP, Java) and REST API (JSON).</p>

<p>With a focus on quick Guides, the goal was a clear distinction between Guides, API References and Example Code.</p>

<blockquote class="embedly-card" data-card-key="db853905f7da46498006d870b8bcb67c" data-card-controls="0"><h4><a href="https://docs.respoke.io/">Getting started with Respoke - Respoke Documentation</a></h4><p>Get started with Respoke. Quickstart guides, reference documentation, and FAQs for developers. REST | Javascript</p></blockquote>

<h3>Articles</h3>

<p>Thought leadership technical blog post on blog.respoke.io discussing whether Google's WebRTC adapter.js is a shim or a polyfill and creating a framework for other developers to determine whether a JavaScript library is a shim or a polyfill.</p>

<blockquote class="embedly-card" data-card-key="db853905f7da46498006d870b8bcb67c" data-card-controls="0"><h4><a href="http://blog.respoke.io/post/111278536998/javascript-shim-vs-polyfill">JavaScript: Shim vs Polyfill</a></h4><p>I'm currently working on a conference talk about WebRTC. One of the foundations of any WebRTC library is some form of Google's original adapter.js, which seeks to normalize the WebRTC API across various browsers. As I was about to build this particular slide, one question started to whisper in my ear, "Is adapter.js a shim or a polyfill?"</p></blockquote>

<p>Results?</p>

<p>Google search result rank number three for the topic.</p>

<p>Fun technical blog post written for blog.respoke.io mashing up two popular concepts: WebRTC and Instagram Filters.</p>

<blockquote class="embedly-card" data-card-key="db853905f7da46498006d870b8bcb67c" data-card-controls="0"><h4><a href="http://blog.respoke.io/post/112690645356/webrtc-instagram-video-filters">WebRTC Instagram Video Filters</a></h4><p>With more than a $1 Billion valuation and over 75 million daily users, Instagram is arguably one of the most popular social networks today.

<p>Thought leadership piece discussing the story of JavaScript told through the eyes of Joseph Campbell's "Hero's Journey".</p>

<blockquote class="embedly-card" data-card-key="db853905f7da46498006d870b8bcb67c" data-card-controls="0"><h4><a href="http://tiandavis.com/thoughts/posts/javascript-and-the-monomyth/">JavaScript and The Monomyth</a></h4><p>In his seminal work, "The Hero with a Thousand Faces", Joseph Campbell put forth the idea of The Monomyth. The idea is based on the observation that a common pattern exists beneath the narrative elements of most great myths, regardless of their origin or time of creation. Simply put, all of mankind's myriad myths are but variations of a single great story. This is the monomyth and is most commonly expressed as a hero's journey....</p></blockquote>

<h2>Strong engineering skills</h2>

<p>I ship hiqh quality code. I've shipped critical components on both Respoke's Community Team and Respoke's Front-End Team. Prior to that, I shipped as a Tech Lead at Nationwide and as a consultant in various industries from banking to education to medical to military simulation and training.</p>

<p><br></p>

<h3>Apollo HD</h3>

<p>Sometimes you get the chance to write the best code of your life when you least expect it. I got that chance at <a href="https://www.respoke.io/" title="Respoke Url">Respoke</a>, a communication PaaS startup built on WebRTC.</p>

<p><img src="/images/apollo-dark.png" title="Apollo Dark" alt="Apollo" /></p>

<p>As a JavaScript Engineer on the Respoke team, I helped developers see how easily we can add secure video, voice and data communication to our own apps using the power of WebRTC.</p>

<p>We used some of the most innovative front-end technologies of the day, including HTML5, CSS3 (LESS), Jade, Gulp, Bootstrap, JavaScript, ES6, Babel, jQuery, Angular, NodeWebkit, Jasmine, Sinon, SuperTest and Phantom.</p>

<p>And with these, we built <a href="https://www.apollohd.com/">Apollo</a> - A powerful Slack competitor that enables team collaboration with chat, screen sharing, live video and voice.</p>

<p><br></p>

<h3>Respoke Sample Project</h3>

<p>Wrote a production-ready sample application showing developers how to use key use cases of Respoke, like Brokered Authentication, Audio Management, Video Management, Data Management, Presence, CallerId and automated tests to make sure the the code sample is always accurate.</p>

<h3>Respoke Server Libraries</h3>

<p>Wrote Respoke PHP and Respoke Java server-side libraries.</p>

<h3>Open Source Contributions</h3>

<p>Contributed a critical bug fix to Respoke.js which prevented screen sharing from working in Firefox and Chrome.</p>

<blockquote class="embedly-card" data-card-key="db853905f7da46498006d870b8bcb67c" data-card-controls="0"><h4><a href="https://github.com/respoke/respoke/commits?author=tiandavis">respoke/respoke</a></h4><p>respoke - Respoke JavaScript Browser/Client Library</p></blockquote>

<p>Extracted Caramel from a Respoke internal tool I built to facilitate cross-platform rendering of Respoke's responsive transactional emails in the various email clients (Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, Mobile, etc).</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>Contributed Yahoo email client fixes upstream to Salted which eventually became the baseline for Respoke's and Caramel's responsive email framework.</p>

<h2>Community Leadership</h2>

<p>I believe in servant leadership and have always served the developer community first and my interests second.</p>

<p><br></p>

<h3>Community Contributions</h3>

<p>Demonstrated both patience and empathy while managing external contributors to both Respoke's open source chan_respoke library and developer documentation.</p>

<blockquote class="embedly-card" data-card-key="db853905f7da46498006d870b8bcb67c" data-card-controls="0"><h4><a href="https://github.com/respoke/chan_respoke/pull/9">Added Channel Variables and AMI Event for Respoke Session by gcareri · Pull Request #9 · respoke/chan_respoke</a></h4><p>Added two new features: Set of Asterisk Channel Variables related to the Respoke Session AMI (Asterisk Manager Interface) new Event 'respoke_session' in order to show the Respoke Session informat...</p></blockquote>


<script async src="//cdn.embedly.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>


<p><br></p>

<h3>Community Advocacy</h3>

<p>In addition to helping developers make progress with Respoke.js, I also acted as an advocate on their behalf; Relaying ease of use issues to the right development team.</p>

<blockquote class="embedly-card" data-card-key="db853905f7da46498006d870b8bcb67c" data-card-controls="0"><h4><a href="http://community.respoke.io/t/sending-json-via-sendmessage-method/84">Sending JSON via sendMessage method</a></h4><p>I am trying to figure out how to send a JSON object via the client's sendMessage method so that my app can send data back and forth between two different clients. The docs only cover how to send a plain string so I have been stabbing in the dark so far.</p></blockquote>


<script async src="//cdn.embedly.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>


<p><br></p>

<h3>Developer Talks</h3>

<p>Toured the east coast, introducing developers to WebRTC - a powerful HTML5 API for encrypted peer-to-peer Voice, Video and Data communications.</p>

<blockquote class="embedly-card" data-card-key="db853905f7da46498006d870b8bcb67c" data-card-controls="0"><h4><a href="https://speakerdeck.com/tiandavis/webrtc-unicorns-narwhals-and-the-real-time-web">WebRTC: Unicorns, Narwhals and The Real-Time Web</a></h4><p>You probably don't know WebRTC as much as you think. I'm not surprised. WebRTC is both amazing and terrifying. No real standards exist between browser vendors. How to integrate WebRTC the right way? WebRTC is but one ingredient to a successful real-time web recipe.</p></blockquote>


<script async src="//cdn.embedly.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>


<p>Along with the talk, distributed a small sample signaling app using Node, Socket.IO showing developers how to get started with WebRTC quickly.</p>

<script async src="//cdn.embedly.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>


<p><br></p>

<p>Another talk focused on the story of JavaScript as seen through the eyes of the Hero's Journey itself.</p>
