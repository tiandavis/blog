<p>To prepare, I wanted to spend some time with Groove to see the application through the eyes of a fresh customer. Spoiler alert - I love the attention to detail and clear appreciation for design.</p>

<p>Here are a few areas I thought would be really cool to iterate on:</p>

<h2>Copying support email should have an effect</h2>

<p>Today, hovering over the [Copy] button has no effect. Also, once clicked, there is no visual cue Groove's inbox email is copied:</p>

<p><img src="/images/groove-copy-support-email-effect.png" title="groove-copy-support-email-effect" alt="Groove" /></p>

<p>The [Copy] button should change slightly on a hover event. When the [Copy] button is clicked, the copied text should flash to let the user know the text was actually copied.</p>

<h2>Larger attachment trigger area needed</h2>

<p>Today, only the elements with an "attach-instructions" class trigger the file attachment event. As the number of attachments grow, it becomes less clear where files can be dragged to:</p>

<p><img src="/images/groove-attachment-area.png" title="groove-attachment-area" alt="Groove" /></p>

<p>The attachment box should have a larger area to trigger an attach event, else the drag &amp; drop “feels” like threading a needle and could aggravate customers.</p>

<h2>JavaScript charts should be vector based</h2>

<p>Canvas based charts are considered harmful because you can’t attach DOM events to chart elements, thereby limiting customization to vendor exposed functionality only:</p>

<p><img src="/images/groove-canvas-charts.png" title="groove-canvas-charts" alt="Groove" /></p>

<p>Less important is they aren’t reliable in lower versions of IE without a polyfill.</p>

<p>Canvas versus SVG is like Photoshop versus Illustrator. Both produce beautiful images, but Illustrator images are scalable and never lose crispness.</p>

<p>Consider switching to SVG based charts.</p>

<p>We could even increase readability and comprehension by spelling out exactly what metrics we want to convey and leverage small inline charts called <a href="http://omnipotent.net/jquery.sparkline/#s-about">sparklines</a>.</p>

<h2>Consensus</h2>

<p>Groove is a beautiful product. Love the app store concept too, though there's still some work to be done there as well.  I could see opening the app store to external developers and creating a Salesforce-like marketplace.</p>

<p>With that strategy, Groove could experience an eco-system growth similar to the explosive growth we saw back in ’08 when Twitter opened its API to external developers.</p>

<h3>Front End Hacker</h3>

<p>Michelangelo never saw a lump of marble.</p>

<p>He saw the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piet%C3%A0_(Michelangelo)">Pieta</a> and he would later write in his diaries about releasing the image inside. I do the same thing with JavaScript. JavaScript is the raw material, the medium that could become great software. I don’t see eccentricities or quirks. I see the new Basecamp, Hubot and Freckle.</p>

<p>For over four years, as a Consultant, I’ve led a Fortune 500 development team through an agile transformation and built some of the best Ruby &amp; JavaScript software of my life. See, work experience below. I’m a Master JavaScript Developer. See, <a href="https://github.com/tiandavis">code samples</a>.</p>

<h2>Code is Poetry</h2>

<p>As a consultant for a major Fortune 500 company, I've done everything from written a full featured REST API in Ruby/Rails to standing up high availability AWS servers (EC2, S3) instances.</p>

<p>But my passion is open standards and front end development:</p>

<p><img src="/images/capabilities.png" title="Core Capabilities" alt="Capabilities" /></p>

<p>The bulk of my front end experience leverages HTML5, CSS3 (SCSS), Compass, Foundation, JavaScript, CoffeeScript, Require, jQuery, Ember, Handlebars, Emblem and EmberScript. I leverage the ember-cli as much as possible.</p>

<p>Testing is near and dear to me. To get the job done, I leverage QUnit, Jasmine, Sinon and Phantom running on Node.</p>

<h3>Galileo</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/tiandavis/galileo">Galileo</a> demonstrates integrating with a third-party API. Here, we integrate with Twitter's API:</p>

<p><img src="/images/galileo-screenshot.png" title="Galileo - JavaScript - Front End" alt="Galileo" /></p>

<p>Galileo organizes a number of open source standards and projects:</p>

<p>On the front end, we use HTML5, CSS3, Foundation, Sass (SCSS), jQuery, Underscore, Backbone and Store.</p>

<p>For front end unit tests, we leverage QUnit, Jasmine for integration tests and Sinon for spies and mocks. The backend integrates nicely with the official Twitter API. See more on <a href="https://github.com/tiandavis/galileo">Github</a>.</p>

<h3>Enigma</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/tiandavis/enigma">Enigma</a> demonstrates best practice application architecture for modern, full stack, mobile ready web applications:</p>

<p>The backend leverages Ruby and Rails to create a REST API. For backend testing, we leverage RSpec for unit tests and FactoryGirl for mocking. We also used Capybara and Selenium for integration tests. See more on <a href="https://github.com/tiandavis/enigma">Github</a>.</p>

<h3>What's next exactly...?</h3>

<p>I write on my blog <a href="http://tiandavis.com/posts/javascript-and-the-monomyth/">8-Bit Hustler</a>. I craft code on <a href="https://github.com/tiandavis">GitHub</a> and share thoughts on <a href="https://twitter.com/tiandavis">Twitter</a> because I love the craft. I co-organize <a href="http://columbuscodecamp.com/">Columbus Code Camp</a> because I love the people even more.</p>

<p>As I understand it, you’ve had a vision of your own Pieta. I’d like a shot at helping you shape a masterpiece. Is there anything stopping you from <a href="mailto:tiandavis@gmail.com">emailing</a> me right now?</p>
