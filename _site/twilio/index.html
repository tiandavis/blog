            <h2>Strong technical writing skills</h2>

<p>demonstrated via blog posts and other written work.</p>

<p>Authoring technical content and documentation for twilio.com, our blog, and other places developers are looking for resources on how to build apps with Twilio.</p>

<p>Thought leadership technical blog post on blog.respoke.io discussing whether Google's WebRTC adapter.js is a shim or a polyfill and creating a framework for other developers to determine whether a JavaScript library is a shim or a polyfill.</p>

<blockquote class="embedly-card" data-card-key="db853905f7da46498006d870b8bcb67c"><h4><a href="http://blog.respoke.io/post/111278536998/javascript-shim-vs-polyfill">JavaScript: Shim vs Polyfill</a></h4><p>I'm currently working on a conference talk about WebRTC. One of the foundations of any WebRTC library is some form of Google's original adapter.js, which seeks to normalize the WebRTC API across various browsers. As I was about to build this particular slide, one question started to whisper in my ear, "Is adapter.js a shim or a polyfill?"</p></blockquote>

<p>Fun technical blog post written for blog.respoke.io mashing up two popular concepts: WebRTC and Instagram Filters.</p>

<blockquote class="embedly-card" data-card-key="db853905f7da46498006d870b8bcb67c"><h4><a href="http://blog.respoke.io/post/112690645356/webrtc-instagram-video-filters">WebRTC Instagram Video Filters</a></h4><p>With more than a $1 Billion valuation and over 75 million daily users, Instagram is arguably one of the most popular social networks today. Did you know more than 55 million photos are posted daily on Instagram? Or that the platform sees over 8,500 likes per second?</p></blockquote>

<h2>Strong engineering skills</h2>

<p>this is not just a technical writing position. You will need to ship code to our customers, and that code will need to work well every time.</p>

<p>Shipping high quality code for some of the most critical components of twilio.com.  Twilio users will interact with your code on the website every day.</p>

<p>Writing production-ready sample applications that developers could put into service right away, demonstrating key Twilio use cases like two-factor authentication, call centers, and notifications.</p>

<p>Creating tests and automation infrastructure to make sure our code samples are always accurate and up to date.</p>

<p>Building command line and graphical authoring tools and utilities for our own internal use, as well as open source projects that will help move the entire state of the art forward for developer education.</p>

<h2>Patience and empathy</h2>

<p>to serve developers first and yourself and your interests second. You love to listen and learn as much as you love to teach.</p>

<p>Managing external contributors as we build out a large library of technical content that will serve developers across multiple languages and platforms.</p>

<h2>Entrepreneurial thinking</h2>

<p>and the ability to act effectively with only high-level direction is also essential.</p>

<p>Defining and creating the future of developer education as we create productive and delightful learning experiences for our developer community.</p>

<h2>Diverse work and educational experience</h2>

<p>will be an asset - Twilio serves mobile developers, web developers, hardware hackers, and every developer in between. The ability to work in a range of technologies will be highly useful.</p>

<h2>Leadership, mentoring, and service</h2>

<p>in developer communities is encouraged and valued.</p>
