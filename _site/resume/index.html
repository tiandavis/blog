            <p>Michelangelo never saw a lump of marble.</p>

<p>He saw the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piet%C3%A0_(Michelangelo)">Pieta</a> and he would later write in his diaries about releasing the image inside. I do the same thing with JavaScript. JavaScript is the raw material, the medium that could become great software. I don’t see eccentricities or quirks. I see the new Basecamp, Hubot and Slack.</p>

<p>Over the last twelve years, as a Front-End Developer and Tech Lead, I’ve done everything from lead a Fortune 500 development team through an agile transformation to writing some of the best JavaScript of my life at distributed startups. I’m a seasoned Software Engineer.</p>

<p><img src="/images/capabilities-1.png" alt="Capabilities" title="Core Capabilities" /></p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="strong-engineering-skills">Strong Engineering Skills</h2>

<p>Currently, I wax poetic with ember.js as a software developer on <a href="https://develop.browzine.com/libraries/222/subjects">BrowZine’s Front-End Engineering</a> Team - a remote startup in the academic and commercial research space.</p>

<p>Previously, I shipped critical components on both Respoke’s Community Team and Respoke’s Front-End Team - a distributed startup in the communication space. Prior to that, I shipped as a Tech Lead at Nationwide and as a consultant in various industries from banking to education to medical to military simulation and training.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="browzine">BrowZine</h3>

<p>I’ve been fortunate, really fortunate, that my startup experience has been shaped with some of the most talented engineers and business leaders I’ve ever worked with.</p>

<p><img src="/images/ember-responsive-acceptance-tests-4.png" alt="ember-responsive acceptance tests" /></p>

<p><img src="/images/capabilities-3.png" alt="Capabilities" title="Core Capabilities" /></p>

<p>I’m currently working with a talented team of co-founders and engineers, leading the <a href="https://develop.browzine.com/libraries/222/subjects/60?sort=rank">retrofitting</a> of our existing Ember.js desktop web application with a mobile responsive UI/UX. The project is coming along well so far. Resize your browser to try it out live. :)</p>

<p>The application is built using Ember CLI, Sass and QUnit for testing on the frontend, running atop a Node Express API and Mocha for testing on the backend with CircleCI for continuous integration.</p>

<p><img src="/images/subjects-search.png" alt="ember-responsive acceptance tests" /></p>

<p><img src="/images/subject-details.png" alt="ember-responsive acceptance tests" /></p>

<p><img src="/images/journal-toc.png" alt="ember-responsive acceptance tests" /></p>

<p>Automated acceptance tests are challenging for desktop presentations. They’re are doubly challenging for responsive presentations, but we’ve even made progress running our automated acceptance tests against our mobile responsive UI.</p>

<p>Learn more about how we got our <a href="/thoughts/posts/ember-responsive-acceptance-tests">ember responsive</a> UI under test.</p>

<p>Also, lead the integration of a third-party title discovery solution called <a href="http://msulibrariestest.summon.serialssolutions.com/#!/search?ho=t&amp;l=en&amp;q=new%20england%20journal%20of%20medicine">Summon</a> with the BrowZine API, ultimately building an open source project called <a href="https://github.com/thirdiron/browzine-summon-adapter">browzine-summon-adapter</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/browzine-summon-adapter.png" alt="browzine-summon-adapter screenshot" /></p>

<p>Summon is built on Angular 1.6.x, so browzine-summon-adapter is able to take advantage of Angular’s extensibility and act as a drop-in enhancement to Summon search results; Adding links to Journals (View the Journal) and Articles (View Complete Issue) in BrowZine as well as enhance Summon search results with BrowZine Journal Covers.</p>

<p>Using Angular, Karma and Jasmine, built an <a href="https://github.com/thirdiron/browzine-summon-adapter/blob/develop/tests/acceptance/browzine-summon-adapter-test.js">acceptance test</a> suite to guard against regressions. This project also integrates with CircleCI for continuous integration.</p>

<h3 id="apollo-hd">Apollo HD</h3>

<p>Sometimes you get the chance to write the best code of your life when you least expect it. I got that chance at <a href="https://www.respoke.io/" title="Respoke Url">Respoke</a>, a communication PaaS startup built on WebRTC.</p>

<p><img src="/images/apollo-dark.png" alt="Apollo" title="Apollo Dark" /></p>

<p>As a JavaScript Engineer on the Respoke team, I helped developers see how easily we can add secure video, voice and data communication to our own apps using the power of WebRTC.</p>

<p>We used some of the most innovative front-end technologies of the day, including HTML5, CSS3 (LESS), Jade, Gulp, Bootstrap, JavaScript, ES6, Babel, jQuery, Angular, NodeWebkit, Jasmine, Sinon, SuperTest and Phantom:</p>

<p><img src="/images/capabilities-2.png" alt="Capabilities" title="Core Capabilities" /></p>

<p>And with these, we built <a href="https://www.apollohd.com/">Apollo</a> - A powerful Slack competitor that enables team collaboration with chat, screen sharing, live video and voice.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="open-source-contributions-oss">Open Source Contributions (OSS)</h3>

<p>During an ember-cli upgrade for BrowZine, found a critical bug in a major ember addon called ember-component-css. Analyzed the bug and submitted a PR to fix the same. We found the root cause to be in a dependency of ember-component-css called ember-cli-saas, but this PR helped folks make progress until we could get a fix upstream.</p>

<p>Thought leadership technical blog post on blog.respoke.io discussing whether Google’s WebRTC adapter.js is a shim or a polyfill and creating a framework for other developers to determine whether a JavaScript library is a shim or a polyfill.</p>

<blockquote class="embedly-card" data-card-key="db853905f7da46498006d870b8bcb67c" data-card-controls="0"><h4><a href="http://blog.respoke.io/post/111278536998/javascript-shim-vs-polyfill">JavaScript: Shim vs Polyfill</a></h4><p>I'm currently working on a conference talk about WebRTC. One of the foundations of any WebRTC library is some form of Google's original adapter.js, which seeks to normalize the WebRTC API across various browsers. As I was about to build this particular slide, one question started to whisper in my ear, "Is adapter.js a shim or a polyfill?"</p></blockquote>

<p>Thought leadership piece discussing the story of JavaScript told through the eyes of Joseph Campbell’s “Hero’s Journey”.</p>

The idea is based on the observation that a common pattern exists beneath the narrative elements of most great myths, regardless of their origin or time of creation. Simply put, all of mankind's myriad myths are but variations of a single great story. This is the monomyth and is most commonly expressed as a hero's journey....</p></blockquote>
