            <p>Michelangelo never saw a lump of marble.</p>

<p>He saw the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piet%C3%A0_(Michelangelo)">Pieta</a> and he would later write in his diaries about releasing the image inside. I do the same thing with code. Code is the raw material, the medium that could become great software. I don’t see eccentricities or quirks. I see the new Basecamp, Hubot and Slack.</p>

<p>Over the last five years, as a Tech Lead and Front-End Developer, I’ve done everything from lead a Fortune 500 development team through an agile transformation to writing some of the best JavaScript of my life at a distributed startup. I'm a Software Engineer.</p>

<p><img src="/images/capabilities-1.png" title="Core Capabilities" alt="Capabilities" /></p>

<p><br></p>

<h2>Strong engineering skills</h2>

<p>I ship hiqh quality code. I've shipped critical components on both Respoke's Community Team and Respoke's Front-End Team. Prior to that, I shipped as a Tech Lead at Nationwide and as a consultant in various industries from banking to education to medical to military simulation and training.</p>

<p><br></p>

<h3>Apollo HD</h3>

<p>Sometimes you get the chance to write the best code of your life when you least expect it. I got that chance at <a href="https://www.respoke.io/" title="Respoke Url">Respoke</a>, a communication PaaS startup built on WebRTC.</p>

<p><img src="/images/apollo-dark.png" title="Apollo Dark" alt="Apollo" /></p>

<p>As a JavaScript Engineer on the Respoke team, I helped developers see how easily we can add secure video, voice and data communication to our own apps using the power of WebRTC.</p>

<p>We used some of the most innovative front-end technologies of the day, including HTML5, CSS3 (LESS), Jade, Gulp, Bootstrap, JavaScript, ES6, Babel, jQuery, Angular, NodeWebkit, Jasmine, Sinon, SuperTest and Phantom:</p>

<p><img src="/images/capabilities-2.png" title="Core Capabilities" alt="Capabilities" /></p>

<p>And with these, we built <a href="https://www.apollohd.com/">Apollo</a> - A powerful Slack competitor that enables team collaboration with chat, screen sharing, live video and voice.</p>

<p><br></p>

<h3>Respoke Server Libraries</h3>

<p>Wrote Respoke PHP and Respoke Java server-side libraries.</p>

<h2>Community Leadership</h2>

<p>I believe in servant leadership and have always served the developer community first and my interests second.</p>

<p><br></p>

<h3>Community Contributions</h3>

<p>Demonstrated both patience and empathy while managing external contributors to both Respoke's open source chan_respoke library and developer documentation.</p>

<blockquote class="embedly-card" data-card-key="db853905f7da46498006d870b8bcb67c" data-card-controls="0"><h4><a href="https://github.com/respoke/chan_respoke/pull/9">Added Channel Variables and AMI Event for Respoke Session by gcareri · Pull Request #9 · respoke/chan_respoke</a></h4><p>Added two new features: Set of Asterisk Channel Variables related to the Respoke Session AMI (Asterisk Manager Interface) new Event 'respoke_session' in order to show the Respoke Session informat...</p></blockquote>

<p><br></p>

<h3>Community Advocacy</h3>

<p>In addition to helping developers make progress with Respoke.js, I also acted as an advocate on their behalf; Relaying ease of use issues to the right development team.</p>

<blockquote class="embedly-card" data-card-key="db853905f7da46498006d870b8bcb67c" data-card-controls="0"><h4><a href="http://community.respoke.io/t/sending-json-via-sendmessage-method/84">Sending JSON via sendMessage method</a></h4><p>I am trying to figure out how to send a JSON object via the client's sendMessage method so that my app can send data back and forth between two different clients.

<p><br></p>

<h3>Developer Talks</h3>

<p>Toured the east coast, introducing developers to WebRTC - a powerful HTML5 API for encrypted peer-to-peer Voice, Video and Data communications.</p>

<blockquote class="embedly-card" data-card-key="db853905f7da46498006d870b8bcb67c" data-card-controls="0"><h4><a href="https://speakerdeck.com/tiandavis/webrtc-unicorns-narwhals-and-the-real-time-web">WebRTC: Unicorns, Narwhals and The Real-Time Web</a></h4><p>You probably don't know WebRTC as much as you think. I'm not surprised. WebRTC is both amazing and terrifying. No real standards exist between browser vendors. How to integrate WebRTC the right way? WebRTC is but one ingredient to a successful real-time web recipe.</p></blockquote>


<script async src="//cdn.embedly.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>


<p>Along with the talk, distributed a small sample signaling app using Node, Socket.IO showing developers how to get started with WebRTC quickly.</p>

<p>Another talk focused on the story of JavaScript as seen through the eyes of the Hero's Journey itself.</p>

<h2>Strong technical writing skills</h2>

<p>Take a look at a few screencasts and blog posts I produced along the way.</p>

<p><br></p>

<h3>Screencasts</h3>

<p>Technical screencast showing Subversion developers how to <a href="/screencasts/git-for-tortoise-svn-developers/">get production ready using Git</a>.</p>

<blockquote class="embedly-card" data-card-key="db853905f7da46498006d870b8bcb67c" data-card-controls="0"><h4><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nUAd3-x_a4">Git for Tortoise SVN Developers (1/8)</a></h4><p>Git is a powerful source code management platform. What many don't know is Git can be a very flexible and forgiving source code management tool as well. If you're coming from a Subversion client like TortoiseSVN and want to start being productive with Git immediately, then this course is for you.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Articles</h3>

<p>Thought leadership technical blog post on blog.respoke.io discussing whether Google's WebRTC adapter.js is a shim or a polyfill and creating a framework for other developers to determine whether a JavaScript library is a shim or a polyfill.</p>

<blockquote class="embedly-card" data-card-key="db853905f7da46498006d870b8bcb67c" data-card-controls="0"><h4><a href="http://blog.respoke.io/post/111278536998/javascript-shim-vs-polyfill">JavaScript: Shim vs Polyfill</a></h4><p>I'm currently working on a conference talk about WebRTC. One of the foundations of any WebRTC library is some form of Google's original adapter.js, which seeks to normalize the WebRTC API across various browsers. As I was about to build this particular slide, one question started to whisper in my ear, "Is adapter.js a shim or a polyfill?"</p></blockquote>

<p>Results?</p>

<p>Google search result rank number three for the topic.</p>

<p>Fun technical blog post written for blog.respoke.io mashing up two popular concepts: WebRTC and Instagram Filters.</p>

<blockquote class="embedly-card" data-card-key="db853905f7da46498006d870b8bcb67c" data-card-controls="0"><h4><a href="http://blog.respoke.io/post/112690645356/webrtc-instagram-video-filters">WebRTC Instagram Video Filters</a></h4><p>With more than a $1 Billion valuation and over 75 million daily users, Instagram is arguably one of the most popular social networks today. Did you know more than 55 million photos are posted daily on Instagram? Or that the platform sees over 8,500 likes per second?</p></blockquote>

<p>Thought leadership piece discussing the story of JavaScript told through the eyes of Joseph Campbell's "Hero's Journey".</p>

<blockquote class="embedly-card" data-card-key="db853905f7da46498006d870b8bcb67c" data-card-controls="0"><h4><a href="http://tiandavis.com/thoughts/posts/javascript-and-the-monomyth/">JavaScript and The Monomyth</a></h4><p>In his seminal work, "The Hero with a Thousand Faces", Joseph Campbell put forth the idea of The Monomyth. The idea is based on the observation that a common pattern exists beneath the narrative elements of most great myths, regardless of their origin or time of creation. Simply put, all of mankind's myriad myths are but variations of a single great story. This is the monomyth and is most commonly expressed as a hero's journey....</p></blockquote>
