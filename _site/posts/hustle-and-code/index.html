<p>Slow down. Learn the Fundamentals. And Hustle. Because learning to develop good software takes ten years. A lot of people will disagree with me on this. A lot of big people <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic">already have</a> and many of us are still cleaning up that mess.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/HtDP2e/index.html">How to Design Programs</a>, the authors said it well, &quot;Bad programming is easy. <em>Idiots</em> can learn it in <em>21 days</em>, even if they are <em>Dummies</em>.&quot; </p>

<p>But this isn&#39;t 1991 and the tragedy that was Visual Basic (VB). This isn&#39;t a time when the 21 days paradigm turned everyone - from Help Desk Support to Accountants to Managers to Lawyers - into overnight programmers. Yet, still this notion of learn to program overnight lingers more tragically than even The Bard himself could imagine.</p>

<h3>Why is everyone in such a rush?</h3>

<p>In <a href="http://norvig.com/21-days.html">Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years</a>, author Peter Norvig posits the quintessential question in this knowledge arms race, &quot;Why is everyone in such a rush?&quot;</p>

<p>To bring the point home, Norvig did an Amazon search to see how many book titles promised to teach you something in X amount of days. He received 248 hits. Later he swapped <em>days</em> with <em>hours</em> with similar results at 253 hits. Norvig goes on to note that 96% of the titles returned were computer and programming related. That was 2001.</p>

<p>Fast-forward to 2011 and the results are even more astounding. If you want to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/ix=books&amp;rank=%2Bfeaturedrank&amp;fqp=power%01pubdate%3A%20after%201992%20and%20title%3A%20days%20and%0D%20%28title%3A%20learn%20or%20title%3A%20teach%20yourself%29&amp;sz=25&amp;pg=1/ref=s_b_np">teach yourself something in X days</a>, you&#39;ll find 950 titles at your disposal. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/ix=books&amp;rank=%2Bfeaturedrank&amp;fqp=power%01pubdate%3A%20after%201992%20and%20title%3A%20hours%20and%0D%20%28title%3A%20learn%20or%20title%3A%20teach%20yourself%29&amp;sz=25&amp;pg=3/ref=s_b_np">Swap days with hours</a> and you&#39;ll find 675 titles.</p>

<p>That&#39;s 3 to 4 times more titles than just a decade ago. In both cases, programming titles are the the overwhelming majority. In particular, the <em>hours</em> category has a higher density of computer programming books than the <em>days</em> category.</p>

<p>Hours? Learn to program in Hours? You can&#39;t learn the necessary fundamentals in hours, nor days. It takes years! It takes Ten Years! </p>

<h3>The Fundamentals - You can&#39;t rush good wine!</h3>

<p>Like good wine, you can&#39;t rush good programming. It will take time. You won&#39;t learn it in 24 hours. But with passion and purpose and lots and lots of practice, you can get good - really good!</p>

<p>You don&#39;t necessarily have to finish a four-year Computer Engineering or Computer Science program. But you do need drilled, hands-on fundamentals. For everyone, where you get those fundamentals will be - guess what - fundamentally different.</p>

<p>For some, you will be an apprentice to a parent, older sibling or mentor. For others, you might start programming games as a youngling. Still, for others, you will go to University for the fundamentals and if you are lucky, leave before the other nonsense.</p>

<p>But each of you will have a different, diverse story and that&#39;s Ok! That&#39;s the DNA that will shape your decisions and the projects you pursue. </p>

<p>The point is there are fundamentals in the development game and no matter how you get it, you better have it! You can&#39;t rush the fundamentals either - they need time to mature and coarse through your veins. The fundamentals need time to learn you!</p>

<h3>You&#39;ve got to Hustle to get Good!</h3>

<p>Sorry to say, but you&#39;re not going to get good grinding assignments in a grey cube for eight hours-a-day. Nothing inherently with the color grey stops you either. It&#39;s just that mentorship seldom takes place in corporate life.</p>

<p>If you have the opportunity to learn from a master developer in a corporate environment - consider yourself lucky and thank him or her. But most importantly, when it&#39;s your turn, pass on what you&#39;ve learned.</p>

<p>But for the other 98% of you, the mentorship isn&#39;t coming so you&#39;ve gotta hustle. You&#39;ve gotta get out of your comfort zone and work on different teams shipping different types of software.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve gotta work for the megalomaniacal failed bed bug researcher turned IT Executive since he can tell a great story and once taught a call girl Excel.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve gotta work for the spoiled rich kid who will make you Director of Technology (or pick your own title) if you promise to work 21 hours a day and hook an intravenous (IV) of Red Bull to your medulla oblongata.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve gotta work for people who&#39;s agenda is everything but making good software. It&#39;s in those darkest hours that your judgement is intensified. It is in those darkest nights that your character is solidified and your religion hardened.</p>

<p>Those are the times where you&#39;ll learn what&#39;s right, what&#39;s wrong and what needs more time to simmer. Those are the times when you&#39;ll get to see the effects of bad architecture and bad design and how that makes your Users feel. Those are the times when you&#39;ll learn which decisions make sense and which don&#39;t. Those are the times when you&#39;ll learn to say, &quot;Hell No!&quot; and mean it!</p>

<p>But most importantly, those are the times when you&#39;ll either learn to take responsibility for the software decisions you make or you&#39;ll join the countless many who&#39;ve decided to never take responsibility for the decisions they make. These are the experiences that make great product designers and you will draw on them time-and-time again.</p>

<h3>Spartan or Arcadian? Warrior or Brawler?</h3>

<p>The way I see it, you have two choices. Learn from Dummies and be an Arcadian - a brawler at best. Or face your personal Agoge and emerge a Spartan - an Elite Warrior.</p>

<p>You can make the cleanest light saber you want. But you can&#39;t be a Jedi until you&#39;ve faced your Vader. You&#39;ve gotta hustle! And if you survive, you will have joined the elite and be able to smell bullshit and bad code a mile away - sometimes at the same time.</p>

<p>And in that time, you&#39;ll learn to appreciate Design Patterns, Software Architecture and Modern Object Oriented Design. In that time, you&#39;ll learn to love Object Relational Mappers (ORM), Separation of Concerns (SoC) and User Experiences (UX).</p>

<p>Programming for Dummies won&#39;t teach you these - Dummies don&#39;t care about these! They care about getting things done the quickest so they can look smarter than you. They don&#39;t care about the end User. They don&#39;t care about how the software will be installed. They don&#39;t even care about how they will maintain the software. But you must!</p>

<p>Dummies care about the latest IDE and the latest shiny runtime features. They don&#39;t care about the deep mentorship and bonding that comes from Code Reviews and discussing best practices with an open mind.</p>

<p>Programming for Dummies won&#39;t teach you to appreciate data integrity or domain modeling. Programming for Dummies won&#39;t teach you how to value your software team. You&#39;ve got to learn to value these precepts on your own!</p>

<h3>Don&#39;t back down - Step up!</h3>

<p>You don&#39;t want to be an Arcadian, you want to be a Spartan. We need you to be a Spartan. And that&#39;s not happening in 30 or 21 days. It&#39;s not happening in 24 or 12 hours. And it&#39;s certainly not going to happen learning from Sams or any other Dummy.</p>

<p>But you can do it! You can learn the proper Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). You can learn to care about your users and your team. It&#39;s a lot to learn and a lot to take in. I know this and I know it can seem like a mountain to climb. But always remember this: <em>It Ain&#39;t the Size of the Dog in the Fight, It&#39;s the Size of the Fight in the Dog</em>.</p>

<p>What&#39;s the rush? Slow down. Learn the Fundamentals. And Hustle. Cause learning to develop good software takes ten years. Hustle and Code. Get used to it.</p>
