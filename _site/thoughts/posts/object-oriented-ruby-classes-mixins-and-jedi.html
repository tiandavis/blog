<h3 id="objects">Objects</h3>

<p>An object is an instance of a class. Each instance having its own unique attributes and state.</p>

<h4 id="dojorb">dojo.rb</h4>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s1">'Jedi'</span>

<span class="n">anakin</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Jedi</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Anakin"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">anakin</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">duel</span>
<span class="n">anakin</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">lightsaber</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Ruby"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">anakin</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">juyo</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Here, the <em>anakin</em> object is an instance of the Jedi class. Apparently, Anakin is having trouble with some galactic fraktards and fires up his Ruby lightsaber using the <em>lightsaber</em> method. Then Anakin proceeds to bring the hurt using a lightsaber combat form called <a href="https://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Lightsaber_combat">Juyo</a>.</p>

<p>Using the Jedi class is deceivingly simple. That simplicity is possible because of a well designed domain model (collection of ruby classes that model a particular system).</p>

<p>In this article, I’ll take you behind the scenes and show you the techniques you need to write clean, maintainable and awesome Ruby code.</p>

<h3 id="ruby-classes">Ruby Classes</h3>

<p>In Ruby, an class (object) encapsulates a group of attributes (state) and methods (operations). A developer manipulates an object’s state (instance variables) only through class accessors and methods.</p>

<h4 id="jedirb">Jedi.rb</h4>

<p>Here’s how a Jedi class might look:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s1">'Padawan'</span>
<span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s1">'Forms'</span>

<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Jedi</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">Padawan</span>
  <span class="kp">include</span> <span class="no">Forms</span>

  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">initialize</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">'Unknown'</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="vi">@name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">name</span>
    <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Jedi.initialize"</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>

  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">duel</span>
    <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Only a Sith deals in absolutes."</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></figure>

<h4 id="padawanrb">Padawan.rb</h4>

<p>And the Padawan class might look like this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s1">'Force'</span>
<span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s1">'Lightsaber'</span>

<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Padawan</span>
  <span class="nb">attr_accessor</span> <span class="ss">:name</span>

  <span class="kp">include</span> <span class="no">Force</span>
  <span class="kp">include</span> <span class="no">Lightsaber</span>

  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">inspect</span>
    <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Force-Sensitive: "</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="vi">@name</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Padawan would be derived from maybe a <em>Sentient</em> class. But for simplicity I’m including in the Padawan class attributes you might have seen in a class like <em>Sentient</em>. For example, the <em>@name</em> attribute.</p>

<h4 id="constructor-initialization">Constructor (Initialization)</h4>

<p>The initialized method is Ruby’s constructor method for class implementations. It’s called whenever a new instance of a class is created. For example, here a new instance of the Jedi class is called. The result is the <em>anakin</em> object:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="c1">#dojo.rb</span>
<span class="n">anakin</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Jedi</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Anakin"</span><span class="p">)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This example illustrates a beautiful feature of Ruby - <em>Flexible Initialization</em>. This means you have the option to pass a parameter or not:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="c1">#Jedi.rb</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">initialize</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">'Unknown'</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="vi">@name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">name</span>
    <span class="p">.</span> <span class="nf">.</span> <span class="p">.</span>
<span class="nf">end</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>You can choose not to pass a parameter. In that case, creating an instance of the Jedi object might look like this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="n">sith</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Jedi</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>And the default value of the <em>@name</em> attribute would be <em>Unknown</em>.</p>

<h4 id="inspect">Inspect</h4>
<p>You’ve noticed by now that when we try to look at an object directly, we are shown something cryptic like <em>&lt;#Jedi:0x101237498 @name=”Anakin”&gt;</em>. This is just a default behavior, and we are free to change it.</p>

<p>All we need to do is add a method named <em>inspect</em>. You should return a string that describes the object in some meaningful way - including the states of some or all of its instance attributes.</p>

<p>Here, we return the value of the <em>@name</em> attribute on the Padawan class. In this instance of the Jedi object, the value of the <em>@name</em> attribute is Anakin. So I setup the <em>inspect</em> method to return  <em>Force-Sensitive: Anakin</em>.</p>

<p>Run <em>irb</em> from Terminal. Then <em>load ‘dojo.rb’</em>. And type <em>Anakin</em>. Type <em>Exit</em> to leave irb.</p>

<h4 id="accessors">Accessors</h4>

<p>A class may have many attributes. It really all depends on the domain you’re trying to model. Accessing those attributes directly is not a good practice. Instead, you should create accessors to read and write to those attributes.</p>

<p>To accomplish this in some languages is a pain. You would have to define a <em>getter</em> method and <em>setter</em> method for each class attribute. Imagine having 10 attributes. That’s 20 different accessors you would have to write - in addition to writing your attributes!</p>

<p>Ruby has a more elegant solution - the attr_accessor shortcut:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Padawan</span>
  <span class="nb">attr_accessor</span> <span class="ss">:name</span>
  <span class="p">.</span> <span class="nf">.</span> <span class="p">.</span>
<span class="nf">end</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This gets you the following Ruby class methods for FREE:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="c1">#attr_reader</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">name</span>
  <span class="vi">@name</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="c1">#attr_writer</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">name</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">value</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="vi">@name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">value</span>
<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Awesome! This is at once elegant and beautiful. You can add as much attribute accessors as you like: attr_accessor :name, :weight, :etc.</p>

<p>You’re not going to always want a <em>getter</em> and <em>setter</em>. Sometimes you might only need one. You can do that in Ruby:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="nb">attr_reader</span> <span class="ss">:midi_chlorian</span>
<span class="nb">attr_writer</span> <span class="ss">:heart_rate</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>You get the picture!</p>

<h4 id="methods">Methods</h4>

<p>Methods are how we interact with our Ruby classes. Methods allow us to encapsulate activities specific to the particular class:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="c1">#Jedi.rb</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">duel</span>
  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Only a Sith deals in absolutes."</span>
<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Methods sometimes perform work on a Ruby classes’ attributes. Sometimes a method just performs work specific to the class. In our Jedi class, we have a <em>duel</em> method. This method is used to convey some Jedi axiom just before battle begins.</p>

<p>Like an initialize constructor, a method can take parameters. A Ruby method can even have a default parameter. So our <em>duel</em> method could have looked like:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="c1">#Jedi.rb</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">duel</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">opponent</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">'Sith'</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"You disappoint me "</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">opponent</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s2">"."</span>
  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Only a Sith deals in absolutes."</span>
<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Coming from static languages, Ruby’s minimalistic approach to object oriented programming is at once refreshing and inspiring.</p>

<p>Still with me? Great! Let’s move on to more advanced topics.</p>

<h3 id="inheritance">Inheritance</h3>

<p>Eventually, you’ll reach a situation where different Ruby classes have the same attribute and perform the same basic actions.</p>

<p>We know that a Jedi evolved from a Padawan. Therefore, a Jedi should posses the skills of a Padawan with the further developed skills of a Jedi Knight.</p>

<p>In Ruby, such relationships can be expressed using inheritance. Here, the Padawan class is called the parent class:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Jedi</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">Padawan</span>
<span class="p">.</span> <span class="nf">.</span> <span class="p">.</span>
<span class="nf">end</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>In this way we can reuse the Padawan class for other force-sensitives that we wouldn’t consider Jedi. For example, we could have a Sith class:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Sith</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">Padawan</span>
<span class="p">.</span> <span class="nf">.</span> <span class="p">.</span>
<span class="nf">end</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Darth Vader was once a Padawan until he turned to the Dark Side and became a Sith Lord. As such, you would expect him to have the knowledge and training of a Padawan with the learning of a Dark Knight.</p>

<h4 id="polymorphism">Polymorphism</h4>

<p>There will be cases where certain methods of the parent class will need to be implemented differently in the inheriting class. For example:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Sith</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">Padawan</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">inspect</span>
    <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Peace is a lie. There is only passion. - "</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="vi">@name</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Here, the <em>inspect</em> method from the <em>Sith</em> class will be used instead of the <em>inspect</em> method from the <em>Padawan</em> class. Object oriented languages (like Ruby) that facilitate this type of behavior are said to be polymorphic. Therefore, the above is an example of Polymorphism.</p>

<p>Rather than exhaustively define every characteristic of every new class, we only need to redefine the differences between the parent class and the child class.</p>

<h4 id="does-ruby-support-multiple-inheritance">Does Ruby support multiple inheritance?</h4>

<p>No. Ruby was designed with single inheritance. This was on purpose. Single inheritance encourages you to develop a deeper understanding of your domain model.</p>

<p>That said, there are times when a domain model could benefit from sharing methods that do not require a full blown class. That’s where Ruby Mixins come in.</p>

<h3 id="mixins">Mixins</h3>

<p>Mixins are Ruby modules. Modules are a collection of methods. You cannot create an instance of a module. Therefore, modules do not maintain state.</p>

<p>After requiring a Ruby module, you would then include that module in your Ruby class. This is called a Mixin:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s1">'Lightsaber'</span>

<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Padawan</span>
  <span class="p">.</span> <span class="nf">.</span> <span class="p">.</span>
  <span class="nf">include</span> <span class="no">Lightsaber</span>
  <span class="p">.</span> <span class="nf">.</span> <span class="p">.</span>
<span class="nf">end</span></code></pre></figure>

<h4 id="lightsaberrb">Lightsaber.rb</h4>

<p>Here is the Mixin Lightsaber module:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">module</span> <span class="nn">Lightsaber</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">lightsaber</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">crystal</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"Jade"</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Lightsaber.initialized: "</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">crystal</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>So when I instantiate an instance of the Jedi class, I get access to the Lightsaber module - pure Mixin love:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="c1">#dojo.rb</span>
<span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s1">'Jedi'</span>

<span class="n">anakin</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Jedi</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Anakin"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">.</span> <span class="nf">.</span> <span class="p">.</span>
<span class="nf">anakin</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">lightsaber</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Ruby"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">.</span> <span class="nf">.</span> <span class="o">.</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Modules are for sharing behavior (methods), while classes are for modeling relationships between objects. Ruby classes can Mixin a module and receive all its methods for free.</p>

<h4 id="active-record---base-class-or-mixin">Active Record - Base Class or Mixin?</h4>

<p>We might think Active Record should have been included rather than extended by a subclass. You can use your own parent class at that point right?</p>

<p>So should Active Record have been implemented as a Mixin instead of a Base Class? Hell No!</p>

<p>Saying it should is a half-truth at best. What never follows such statements is a disclosure that you will spend exorbitant amounts of time mapping your class attributes to a database DSL (domain specific language).</p>

<p>This behavior really adds up to your detriment when dealing with larger domain models. But this is never said. It’s that little gotcha that, not surprisingly, never gets mentioned.</p>

<p>I believe for the best speed, simplicity and maintainability, Active Record is best implemented as a base class that you inherit with a single line.</p>

<p>Compare that to the many lines you will spend to map your class attributes to database types. It really is a no-brainer.</p>

<p>I could stop here, but I believe you’ll be able to make better judgments when you have a fuller picture of the issue. So I’m going to tell you when implementing Active Record as a mixin makes sense.</p>

<p>It makes sense when you’re dealing with legacy code that already has a base class coupled with an inefficient, custom data access layer. Then I recommend using a Ruby ORM like <a href="https://datamapper.org/">Datamapper</a>.</p>

<p>You will spend a lot of time wiring up your domain models, but you’ll get a mature and flexible data layer - just the type of sprucing up any legacy app could use.</p>
